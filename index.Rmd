## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring the relationship between education, location, and political ideologies. I am curious to see whether or not the level and type of education (private, public, religious, etc.) plays a role in how people participate in American politics. I am sure location also plays a substantial role in this relationship, since public schools across America differ widely. I am interested to see which aspect of voters' background, whether it is type of schooling or location, seems to have the highest affect on political affiliation and ideologies.
